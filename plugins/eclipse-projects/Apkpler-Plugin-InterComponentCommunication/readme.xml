	<name abbreviation="icc">Inter-Component Communication</name>
	<description>
		For an Android app, component is its basic building block and a lot of 
		its functionalities are implemented through communication between components.
		However, at the moment, a lot of existing Android analysis tools such as FlowDroid, 
		LeakMiner or AndroidLeaks are not able to perform inter-component communication (ICC) based analysis and 
		this results in inadequate analysis and thereby yields unsound results.
		
		Thus, this plugin is dedicated to solve the ICC problem in which it replaces all ICCs to 
		intra-component communication through explicitly using real code to connect components.
		More specifically, we use Java-style communication mechanism (new-class) to replace all Android-style communication mechanism.
