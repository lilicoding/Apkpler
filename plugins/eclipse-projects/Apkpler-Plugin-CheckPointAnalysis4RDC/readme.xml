	<name abbreviation="rdc">Rename Duplicated Class</name>
	<description>
		Because some file systems are case-insensitive (e.g., Mac OS).
		When file a.b.c.class exists, a.b.C.class will over-write the content of a.b.c.class and 
		case inconsistent that a.b.c.class file contains the content of a.b.C.class.
		However, in some case, at lest in Android applications, the duplicated class names exist.
		For example, an app (Sha256: 0015AE7C27688D45F79170DCEA16131CE557912A1A0C5F3B6B0465EE0774A452) in 
		the Genome project contains duplicated class names.
		When transforming the app to classes, some classes are missing and consequently case problems for 
		other analysis tools that relay on Soot 
		(e.g., Error: class com.adwo.adsdk.s read in from a classfile in which com.adwo.adsdk.S was expected).
